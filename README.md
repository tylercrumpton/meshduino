# Meshduino 
*802.15.4 wireless meshing Python microcontroller using Synapse Wireless SM200 boards*

The Meshduino is a wireless development based on the Synapse SM200 SNAP module, a microcontroller with built-in 802.15.4 wireless meshing that runs Python scripts. It has the same form-factor as an Arduino Uno or similar, and strives to share as many of the same pins as possible.
